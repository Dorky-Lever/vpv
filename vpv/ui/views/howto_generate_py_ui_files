#There are two types of file in here. 

1. The qt ui xml files, which can be edited in qtdesigner
2. The compiled python qt code files


After editing the .ui files, the corresponding .py file can be generated like so:

	`pyuic5 ui_uifile.ui > ui_uifile.py`

pyuic4 can be installed by `apt install pyqt5-dev-tools`
